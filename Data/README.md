# Pima Diabetes Detection using Random Forest

**Random Forest:**
Random forest is a commonly-used machine learning algorithm trademarked by Leo Breiman and Adele Cutler, which combines the output of multiple decision trees to reach a single result. Its ease of use and flexibility have fueled its adoption, as it handles both classification and regression problems.


**Dataset:** The datasets consists of several medical predictor variables and one target variable, Outcome. Predictor variables includes the number of pregnancies the patient has had, their BMI, insulin level, age, and so on.

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install [Numpy](https://numpy.org/), [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) and [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/).

```bash
pip install numpy
```
```bash
pip install pandas
```
```bash
pip install seaborn
```

## Dataset
This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.
